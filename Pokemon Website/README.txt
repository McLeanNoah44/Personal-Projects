App description: Using PokeAPI and the wrapper Pokedex Promise V2, this application offers 2 main
functionalities: searching Pokemon and building a team of 6 (at most) Pokemon. Pokemon are 
searched using API queries, teams are saved using MongoDB, and data is transfered using express.
Finally, this is all built on NodeJS and deployed on Heroku.

NOTE: Due to the nature of the API, for Pokemon with multiple forms (eg. Giratina,
Deoxys, etc.) you will have to search with the syntax "Pokemon-form". For example, to search one
of Giratina's forms, I would search Giratina-origin or Giratina-distortion.
